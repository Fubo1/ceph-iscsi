Python package and systemd configuration to support configuration management tasks when using LIO to provide
an iSCSI gateway to a ceph cluster

This package must be installed on each target gateway host.

In addition to providing the configuration logic (ceph_iscsi_config package), a daemon is also provided which
handles the restoration of the LIO configuration following a node reboot/outage.
