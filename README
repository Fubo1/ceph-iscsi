Common packages to support deployment of iscsi gateways connecting to a 
ceph cluster

These packages need to be installed on each target gateway host. 

In addition to managing the definition of LUNs, Clients and the LIO gateways, this
package also provides the interface for the configuration object used to define the 
desired state of LIO across each of the gateways.
