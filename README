ceph-iscsi-cli installs a targetcli-like interface to allow multiple ceph/iscsi
gateways to be managed from a single interface. The CLI interfaces with the API
exposed in the rbd-target-gw daemon running on each gateway.

The rbd-target-api daemon utilises the flask's internal development server to
provide the REST api. It is normally not used in a production context, but
given this specific use case it provides a simple way to provide an admin
interface - at least for the first release!

API tested with Firefox RESTclient add-on. After importing the self signed cert
and adding basic auth credentials to match the local api configuration, use the
REST client as follows;

Add a Header content type for application/x-www-form-urlencoded
METHOD: PUT        URL: https://192.168.122.69:5001/api/all_gateway/rh7-gw1
select the urlencoded content type and the basic auth credentials
add the required variables to the body section in the client ui
  eg. ip_address=192.168.122.69
Click 'SEND'


Curl examples
Add a gateway
curl --insecure --user admin:admin -d "ip_address=192.168.122.104" \
     -X PUT https://192.168.122.69:5001/api/all_gateway/rh7-gw2
